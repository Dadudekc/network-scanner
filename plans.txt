1. Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection
Integrate machine learning algorithms to analyze network traffic and detect anomalies or potentially malicious activities. This could involve:

Training models on normal network traffic patterns.
Using the models to identify deviations that might indicate security threats.
2. IPv6 Support
Ensure full IPv6 support in addition to IPv4. Given the increasing adoption of IPv6, the ability to handle its complexities and security considerations will be crucial.

3. Advanced OS Fingerprinting
Improve operating system detection techniques to accurately identify devices on the network. This could involve more sophisticated methods than simple banner grabbing, such as analyzing specific packet responses or timing.

4. Encrypted Traffic Analysis
With the increase in encrypted traffic (e.g., HTTPS, TLS), develop capabilities to analyze encrypted sessions for signs of malware or data exfiltration without decrypting the traffic, respecting privacy and legal limitations.

5. Integration with Threat Intelligence Platforms
Automatically cross-reference findings with threat intelligence databases or platforms in real-time to identify known malicious IPs, domains, or services.

6. Automated Vulnerability Assessment
Beyond identifying open ports and services, automatically assess vulnerabilities based on service versions detected and suggest mitigation strategies. This could integrate with databases like CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).

7. Scalability and Distributed Scanning
Enhance the tool to support distributed scanning, allowing it to scale across multiple machines for large network segments. This would be particularly useful for scanning enterprise-level networks efficiently.

8. Compliance and Reporting
Implement features to assist with compliance audits for standards like PCI-DSS, HIPAA, or GDPR. Generate detailed reports that highlight compliance issues, security vulnerabilities, and remediation steps.

9. Customizable Scanning Profiles
Allow users to create and share scanning profiles tailored to different environments or objectives, such as quick scans, deep dives, or specific compliance checks.

10. Blockchain for Data Integrity
Consider using blockchain technology to log scan results in a tamper-proof manner. This could be valuable for forensic analysis and ensuring the integrity of scan data over time.

11. User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)
Incorporate UEBA features to identify potentially risky behaviors based on deviations from established patterns. This can help in detecting insider threats or compromised accounts.

12. Plugin Architecture
Develop a plugin architecture that allows the community to extend the scannerâ€™s capabilities. This encourages collaboration and continuous improvement of the tool.

Implementation Considerations
Implementing these features involves deep technical knowledge and a clear understanding of the ethical and legal considerations of network scanning. Each feature should be developed with a focus on privacy, security, and compliance with relevant laws and standards.
