1. Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection
Data Collection: Secure a dataset of network traffic for training and testing, ensuring it includes a diverse range of normal and anomalous patterns.
Model Selection and Training: Choose suitable machine learning models for anomaly detection. Common choices include supervised models for known anomalies and unsupervised or semi-supervised models for detecting new, unknown patterns.
Integration: Develop a module within your scanner that can analyze traffic in real-time or batch mode to identify anomalies, incorporating feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement of detection accuracy.
2. IPv6 Support
Protocol Understanding: Deep dive into IPv6 specifics, including its addressing scheme, header structure, and inherent security features like IPSec.
Testing Environment: Set up an IPv6-enabled testing environment to ensure your scanner accurately handles IPv6 traffic, addresses, and potential security issues.
3. Advanced OS Fingerprinting
Packet Analysis: Enhance your scanner's ability to analyze packet responses for subtle hints about the operating system, leveraging machine learning or heuristic methods.
Database: Maintain a database of known operating system signatures and regularly update it to improve detection accuracy.
4. Encrypted Traffic Analysis
Behavioral Analysis: Focus on metadata and traffic patterns, such as packet sizes, timing, and protocol behavior, to infer activities within encrypted traffic.
Research and Collaboration: Stay abreast of the latest research in encrypted traffic analysis and collaborate with academic and industry experts to refine your methods.
5. Integration with Threat Intelligence Platforms
API Integration: Integrate APIs from multiple threat intelligence platforms to cross-check IP addresses, URLs, and file hashes against known threat databases.
Real-time Analysis: Implement real-time data fetching and analysis to ensure that the scanner uses the most current information available.
6. Automated Vulnerability Assessment
Vulnerability Database: Integrate with databases like CVE, NVD, or proprietary databases to fetch the latest vulnerability information.
Service Version Matching: After identifying open ports and services, automate the process of matching these against known vulnerabilities based on service versions.
7. Scalability and Distributed Scanning
Distributed Architecture: Design your scanner with a distributed architecture that allows for load distribution across multiple machines or instances.
Management Console: Develop a centralized management console for initiating scans, monitoring progress, and aggregating results from distributed nodes.
8. Compliance and Reporting
Customizable Reports: Implement features for generating customizable reports that cater to different standards (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR) and audience levels (technical, executive).
Compliance Checklists: Provide checklists and guidelines within the tool to help users perform compliance audits more efficiently.
9. Customizable Scanning Profiles
Profile Manager: Develop a profile management system that allows users to create, save, and share scanning profiles tailored to specific needs or compliance requirements.
10. Blockchain for Data Integrity
Blockchain Implementation: Explore blockchain platforms suitable for logging and verifying scan results to ensure data integrity and non-repudiation.
11. User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)
Behavioral Profiling: Implement behavioral profiling to learn normal user and device behavior and use this baseline to identify deviations that may indicate security threats.
12. Plugin Architecture
Extensibility: Design the scanner with a plugin architecture, allowing third parties to extend its functionality by developing and integrating custom modules or plugins.
